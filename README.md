Centralized Referral Collection – I keep all my referral links neatly organized in one place.
Transparent Reward Sharing – I share 50% of my referral rewards with users after verification, ensuring fairness and trust.

Step-by-Step Process – I guide you clearly through each referral:

Sign up using my referral link/code.
Complete the required action (payment, purchase, survey, etc.).
Submit proof via the form (UPI ID, transaction details).
I send your share within 24–48 hours.

India & International Options – I include both Indian apps (Paytm, PhonePe, Flipkart, NAVI, Slice, Meesho) and global platforms (Microsoft Rewards, Amazon, Measure Surveys).
Highlighting Popular & Recommended Apps – I mark certain apps as Hot or Recommended for better visibility.
Claim Form Integration – I provide a built-in form so you can submit details and claim rewards directly.
